# Pysec
Security Demonstration with Python which involves the use of a SHA 1 password cracker which checks online lists for the passwords and adds it to the list if not there. The addition is done by taking the input from a  keylogger and filtering it for valid passwords. Finally, the list of passwords is encoded into an image and the image is hooked to  a deadman's switch which encrypts the file and uses a keyphrase to delete or decrypt the image file.
